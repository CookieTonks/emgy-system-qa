Griffin is a WebApp template for admin dashboards and control panels. It is a responsive HTML template that is based on the CSS framework Bootstrap 4.1.3 It utilizes all of the Bootstrap components in its design and re-styles many commonly used plugins to create a consistent design that can be used as a user interface for backend applications. Griffin Admin is based on a modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and built upon. This documentation will guide you through installing the template and exploring the various components that are bundled with the template.
